# CS5914-High-Performance-Code-Generation-Using-LLMs

Project Name: Tensor Reduction utilizing GPU
This is a course project under CS 5914: High-Performance Code Generation Using LLMs. The objective of this project is to optimize reduction kernels both manually and through LLMs, and try to match performance of the kernels in GPUs. 

## Team Information
- Red team (manual optimization): Najibul Haque Sarker
- Blue team (optimization via LLMs): Prayash Joshi

## Folder Structure
- [`llm_blue`](./llm_blue/) folder contains all the code and scripts required to reproduce results for the blue team (optimization via LLMs). 
- [`manual_red`](./manual_red/) folder contains all the code and scripts required to reproduce results for the red team (manual optimization).

## Setup & Run Code
- [`llm_blue/README.md`](./llm_blue/README.md) file has setup instructions for the blue team (optimization via LLMs).  
- [`manual_red/README.md`](./manual_red/README.md) file has setup instructions for the red team (manual optimization).
