    OPT   This kernel exhibits low compute throughput and memory bandwidth utilization relative to the peak performance 
          of this device. Achieved compute throughput and/or memory bandwidth below 60.0% of peak typically indicate    
          latency issues. Look at Scheduler Statistics and Warp State Statistics for potential reasons.

          This kernel's theoretical occupancy is not impacted by any block limit. The difference between calculated     
          theoretical (100.0%) and measured achieved occupancy (87.6%) can be the result of warp scheduling overheads   
          or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can occur between warps within a block    
          as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices Guide
