    INF   ALU is the highest-utilized pipeline (41.1%) based on active cycles, taking into account the rates of its     
          different instructions. It executes integer and logic operations. It is well-utilized, but should not be a    
          bottleneck.

          The memory access pattern for stores from L1TEX to L2 is not optimal. The granularity of an L1TEX request to  
          L2 is a 128 byte cache line. That is 4 consecutive 32-byte sectors per L2 request. However, this kernel only  
          accesses an average of 1.0 sectors out of the possible 4 sectors per cache line. Check the Source Counters    
          section for uncoalesced stores and try to minimize how many cache lines need to be accessed per memory        
          request.

          Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 1.8 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 16 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of   
          14.58 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 2.20 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps   
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.

          Instructions are executed in warps, which are groups of 32 threads. Optimal instruction throughput is         
          achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early     
          thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp  
          per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 32.0 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced    
          to 20.1 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch.      
          Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads  
          execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible.
