    OPT   This kernel exhibits low compute throughput and memory bandwidth utilization relative to the peak performance 
          of this device. Achieved compute throughput and/or memory bandwidth below 60.0% of peak typically indicate    
          latency issues. Look at Scheduler Statistics and Warp State Statistics for potential reasons.

          theoretical (100.0%) and measured achieved occupancy (88.0%) can be the result of warp scheduling overheads

          as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices Guide
