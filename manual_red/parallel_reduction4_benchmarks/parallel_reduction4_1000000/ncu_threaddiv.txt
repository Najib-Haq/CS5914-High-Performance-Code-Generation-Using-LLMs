    OPT   This kernel exhibits low compute throughput and memory bandwidth utilization relative to the peak performance 
          of this device. Achieved compute throughput and/or memory bandwidth below 60.0% of peak typically indicate    
          latency issues. Look at Scheduler Statistics and Warp State Statistics for potential reasons.

          The memory access pattern for stores from L1TEX to L2 is not optimal. The granularity of an L1TEX request to  
          L2 is a 128 byte cache line. That is 4 consecutive 32-byte sectors per L2 request. However, this kernel only  
          accesses an average of 1.0 sectors out of the possible 4 sectors per cache line. Check the Source Counters    
          section for uncoalesced stores and try to minimize how many cache lines need to be accessed per memory        
          request.

          Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 3.4 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 16 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of   
          12.77 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 1.13 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps   
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, reduce the time the active warps are stalled by inspecting the top stall reasons on the Warp  
          State Statistics and Source Counters sections.

          On average, each warp of this kernel spends 15.4 cycles being stalled waiting for a scoreboard dependency on  
          a L1TEX (local, global, surface, texture) operation. Find the instruction producing the data being waited     
          upon to identify the culprit. To reduce the number of cycles waiting on L1TEX data accesses verify the        
          memory access patterns are optimal for the target architecture, attempt to increase cache hit rates by        
          increasing data locality (coalescing), or by changing the cache configuration. Consider moving frequently     
          used data to shared memory. This stall type represents about 35.3% of the total average of 43.5 cycles        
          between issuing two instructions.

          A wave of thread blocks is defined as the maximum number of blocks that can be executed in parallel on the    
          target GPU. The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical       
          occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 2 full waves and a partial wave of 56 thread blocks.   
          Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, the partial wave may account for   
          up to 33.3% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 25.0%. Try launching a grid with no         
          partial wave. The overall impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for  
          a grid. See the Hardware Model

          This kernel's theoretical occupancy is not impacted by any block limit. The difference between calculated     
          theoretical (100.0%) and measured achieved occupancy (75.0%) can be the result of warp scheduling overheads   
          or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can occur between warps within a block    
          as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices Guide
