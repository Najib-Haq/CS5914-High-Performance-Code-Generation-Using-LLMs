Alright, I need to generate a complete CUDA program where each thread prints "Hello from CUDA thread X!" with X being the thread index. The program should be self-contained, include a main function, and be compilable with nvcc version 12.4.

First, I'll start by setting up the includes. I know that for CUDA, I need to include cuda.h, so I'll add #include <cuda.h> and #include <stdio.h> for standard input/output functions.

Next, I'll define the kernel function. The kernel should be called something like helloKernel. Since each thread needs to print its index, I'll use threadIdx.x because that gives the thread's index within the block. So inside the kernel, I'll have printf("Hello from CUDA thread %d!\n", threadIdx.x);.

Now, I need to set up the main function. In the main function, I'll define the number of threads. Let's choose 10 threads for this example. So I'll set int numThreads = 10;. 

Then, I'll launch the kernel. The syntax for kernel launch is kernel<<<gridSize, blockSize>>>(). Since I want 10 threads, I'll set the grid size to 1 and block size to numThreads. So the launch configuration will be helloKernel<<<1, numThreads>>>();.

I should also include error checking to ensure that the kernel launch was successful. Using cudaGetLastError() and checking if it's not CUDA_SUCCESS, then print an error message and exit. So after the kernel launch, I'll add cudaError_t err = cudaGetLastError(); and if (err != cudaSuccess) { ... }.

Putting it all together, the main function will have the kernel launch, error checking, and then a return 0;.

I should also make sure that the code is properly formatted and that all necessary includes are present. I'll structure the code with the kernel function first, followed by the main function.

Testing the code, I should compile it with nvcc using the specified version. The code should compile without errors and run, printing the messages from each thread.

I think that's all. Let me write the code accordingly.

```cuda
#include <cuda.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void helloKernel() {
    printf("Hello from CUDA thread %d!\n", threadIdx.x);
}

int main() {
    int numThreads = 10;
    helloKernel<<<1, numThreads>>>();
    
    cudaError_t err = cudaGetLastError();
    if (err != cudaSuccess) {
        printf("Kernel launch failed: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));
        return 1;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```
