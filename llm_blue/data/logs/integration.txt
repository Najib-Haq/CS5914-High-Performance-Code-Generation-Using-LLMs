  Okay, so the user wants a CUDA program where each thread prints "Hello from CUDA thread X!" with X being the thread index. They specified that it should be a complete, self-contained program that compiles with nvcc version 12.4.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ^

  I'll start by including cuda.h because that's necessary for CUDA functions. Then, in the main function, I'll set up the kernel launch parameters. The grid and block dimensions need to be defined. For simplicity, I'll choose a grid of 2 blocks and each block having 3 threads, so total 6 threads.

  After defining the kernel, in the main function, I'll launch the kernel with the specified grid and block dimensions. It's important to include cudaDeviceSynchronize() to ensure the kernel completes before the program exits, so the output is visible.

  I should also handle any potential CUDA errors by checking the return values, but since the user didn't specify error handling, I'll keep it simple for now.
