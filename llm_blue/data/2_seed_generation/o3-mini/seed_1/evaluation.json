This ensures efficient handling of very large arrays (up to 1B elements) without launching excessive blocks.\n    2. **Shared Memory Utilization**: Partial sums are stored in shared memory to minimize global memory accesses and leverage fast on-chip memory.\n    3. **Loop Unrolling in Reduction**: The reduction within shared memory is unrolled to reduce loop overhead and increase instruction-level parallelism.\n    4. **Warp-Level Primitives**: For the final steps of the reduction, `__shfl_down_sync` is used to perform warp-level reductions without requiring synchronization, thus minimizing synchronization overhead.\n    5. **Avoiding Bank Conflicts**: Access patterns to shared memory are designed to be coalesced and bank-conflict-free, maximizing memory throughput.\n    6. **Early Exit for Small Sizes**: Boundary conditions are handled to ensure that threads do not access out-of-bounds memory, maintaining correctness across all input sizes.\n    \n    These optimizations collectively enhance performance by maximizing memory bandwidth usage, reducing synchronization costs, and leveraging warp-level parallelism, making the kernel highly efficient for large-scale reductions.\n    */\n\n    extern __shared__ int sdata[];\n\n    unsigned int tid = threadIdx.x;\n    unsigned int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;\n    unsigned int stride = blockDim.x * gridDim.x;\n\n    // Initialize the partial sum for this thread\n    int sum = 0;\n\n    // Grid-stride loop to accumulate partial sums\n    while (idx < size) {\n        sum += input[idx];\n        idx += stride;\n    }\n\n    // Store the partial sum in shared memory\n    sdata[tid] = sum;\n    __syncthreads();\n\n    // Perform tree-based reduction in shared memory\n    // Unroll the reduction loop for better performance\n    for (unsigned int s = blockDim.x / 2; s > 32; s >>= 1) {\n        if (tid < s) {\n            sdata[tid] += sdata[tid + s];\n        }\n        __syncthreads();\n    }\n\n    // Use warp-level primitives for the final warp\n    if (tid < 32) {\n        // Reduce within the warp without synchronization\n        sdata[tid] += sdata[tid + 32];\n        sdata[tid] += sdata[tid + 16];\n        sdata[tid] += sdata[tid + 8];\n        sdata[tid] += sdata[tid + 4];\n        sdata[tid] += sdata[tid + 2];\n        sdata[tid] += sdata[tid + 1];\n    }\n\n    // Write the block's result to the output array\n    if (tid == 0) {\n        output[blockIdx.x] = sdata[0];\n    }\n}",
