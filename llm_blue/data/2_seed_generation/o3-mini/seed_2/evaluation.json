This ensures efficient utilization of all threads, especially for very large arrays (up to 1B elements).\n    \n    2. **Per-Warp Reduction using Warp-Level Primitives**: Utilize `__shfl_down_sync` to perform reductions within each warp without requiring shared memory or synchronization. This leverages the fast warp shuffle instructions to minimize latency and avoid shared memory bank conflicts.\n    \n    3. **Shared Memory for Warp Aggregation**: After per-warp reductions, each warp's partial sum is written to shared memory. A single warp then performs a final reduction on these partial sums. This hierarchical reduction approach reduces the number of synchronization points and memory accesses.\n    \n    4. **Minimized Synchronization**: By confining most reductions to warp-level operations and limiting shared memory usage to a single step, the kernel minimizes the use of `__syncthreads()`, thereby reducing synchronization overhead.\n    \n    5. **Efficient Memory Access Patterns**: Accesses to global memory are coalesced through the grid-stride loop, ensuring maximum memory bandwidth utilization. Shared memory accesses are also optimized to be bank-conflict-free by aligning partial sums per warp.\n    \n    6. **Scalable for All Input Sizes**: The combined use of grid-stride loops and hierarchical reductions ensures that the kernel scales efficiently from small (1K) to very large (1B) input sizes without performance degradation.\n    \n    These optimizations collectively enhance performance by maximizing computational throughput, minimizing memory latency, and reducing synchronization overhead, making the kernel highly efficient across a wide range of input sizes.\n    */\n\n    extern __shared__ int sdata[];\n\n    unsigned int tid = threadIdx.x;\n    unsigned int global_tid = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;\n    unsigned int gridSize = blockDim.x * gridDim.x;\n\n    // Each thread computes a partial sum using a grid-stride loop\n    int sum = 0;\n    for (unsigned int idx = global_tid; idx < size; idx += gridSize) {\n        sum += input[idx];\n    }\n\n    // Perform per-warp reduction using warp-level primitives\n    // Assuming warpSize is 32\n    for (int offset = warpSize / 2; offset > 0; offset /= 2) {\n        sum += __shfl_down_sync(0xFFFFFFFF, sum, offset);\n    }\n\n    // The first thread of each warp writes its partial sum to shared memory\n    if ((threadIdx.x % warpSize) == 0) {\n        sdata[threadIdx.x / warpSize] = sum;\n    }\n\n    __syncthreads();\n\n    // Let the first warp handle the reduction of partial sums in shared memory\n    if (threadIdx.x < (blockDim.x / warpSize)) {\n        sum = (threadIdx.x < (blockDim.x / warpSize)) ? sdata[threadIdx.x] : 0;\n        \n        // Reduce the partial sums using warp-level primitives\n        for (int offset = warpSize / 2; offset > 0; offset /= 2) {\n            sum += __shfl_down_sync(0xFFFFFFFF, sum, offset);\n        }\n\n        // Write the block's total sum to the output array\n        if (threadIdx.x == 0) {\n            output[blockIdx.x] = sum;\n        }\n    }\n}",
