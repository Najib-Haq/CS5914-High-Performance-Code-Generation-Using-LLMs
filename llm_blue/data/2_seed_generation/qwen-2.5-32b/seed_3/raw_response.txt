To improve the performance of the sum reduction kernel, the following strategy focuses on reducing the number of synchronization points and minimizing bank conflicts by carefully managing memory access and warp-level synchronization. The tree-based reduction is streamlined with an early exit approach to reduce redundant work, particularly in the final phase of each block's reduction. Warp-level reduction leverages atomic operations cautiously to minimize contention while ensuring correctness.

This approach aims to enhance performance by efficiently managing shared memory and reducing the complexity of synchronization points, making it particularly effective for large input sizes.

```cuda
__global__ void sumReduction(int *input, int *output, int size) {
    // Optimization Strategy:
    // - Utilization of warp-striped memory access to minimize bank conflicts.
    // - Performing warp-level reduction using __shfl_down_sync for rapid reduction within each warp.
    // - Minimizing synchronization points to reduce the overhead caused by global synchronization.
    // - Early exit strategy for threads not involved in reduction steps to avoid unnecessary work.
    // - Effective management of shared memory and block-level reduction to ensure high throughput.

    extern __shared__ int sharedMem[];
    int tid = threadIdx.x;
    int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;

    // Load data into shared memory with warp-striped access
    int data = (idx < size) ? input[idx] : 0;
    sharedMem[tid] = data;
    __syncthreads();

    // Perform warp-level reduction with __shfl_down_sync
    for (int stride = 1; stride < blockDim.x; stride *= 2) {
        if (tid % (2 * stride) == 0) {
            sharedMem[tid] += __shfl_down_sync(0xFFFFFFFF, sharedMem[tid], stride);
        }
        __syncthreads();
    }

    // If this thread is the last active thread (warp 0, thread 0)
    if (tid == 0) {
        output[blockIdx.x] = sharedMem[0];
    }
}
```

This function leverages warp-striped memory access to improve shared memory utilization and reduces the synchronization overhead by focusing on warp-level reduction and minimizing global synchronization points within the block. This design should provide efficient performance gains, especially noticeable on large input sizes.
