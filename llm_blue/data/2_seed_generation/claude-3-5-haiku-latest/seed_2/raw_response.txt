Here's an optimized CUDA kernel implementing a high-performance sum reduction:

```cuda
__global__ void sumReduction(int *input, int *output, int size) {
    // Optimization Strategy:
    // 1. Combine shuffle-based and shared memory reduction
    // 2. Use warp-level shuffle instructions for initial reduction
    // 3. Minimize global memory accesses and synchronization
    // 4. Handle non-power-of-2 sizes with predicated load
    // 5. Reduce bank conflicts through sequential addressing
    // 6. Leverage instruction-level parallelism with unrolled reduction
    
    // Declare shared memory for final block-level reduction
    extern __shared__ int sharedData[];
    
    // Global thread indices
    int tid = threadIdx.x;
    int globalIdx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    
    // Predicated load with boundary check
    int value = (globalIdx < size) ? input[globalIdx] : 0;
    
    // Warp-level reduction using shuffle instructions
    // Unrolled for better performance
    #pragma unroll
    for (int offset = warpSize/2; offset > 0; offset /= 2) {
        value += __shfl_down_sync(0xffffffff, value, offset);
    }
    
    // Store warp reduction result for first thread of each warp
    if (tid % warpSize == 0) {
        sharedData[tid / warpSize] = value;
    }
    
    // Block-level synchronization
    __syncthreads();
    
    // Final block reduction using shared memory
    // First warp handles final reduction
    if (tid < warpSize) {
        // Load warp reduction results, handling potential empty warps
        value = (tid < (blockDim.x + warpSize - 1) / warpSize) ? 
                sharedData[tid] : 0;
        
        // Final warp-level shuffle reduction
        #pragma unroll
        for (int offset = warpSize/2; offset > 0; offset /= 2) {
            value += __shfl_down_sync(0xffffffff, value, offset);
        }
        
        // First thread writes block result
        if (tid == 0) {
            output[blockIdx.x] = value;
        }
    }
}
```

Key Optimization Features:
- Combines warp-level shuffle instructions with shared memory reduction
- Uses predicated loading to handle non-power-of-2 array sizes
- Unrolled reduction loops for improved instruction-level parallelism
- Minimizes global memory accesses and synchronization points
- Handles large input sizes efficiently through block-level reduction

The strategy focuses on:
1. Reducing global memory bandwidth requirements
2. Leveraging warp-level parallel reduction
3. Minimizing thread divergence
4. Maximizing computational efficiency across different input sizes

This implementation aims to improve performance by:
- Using __shfl_down_sync() for faster warp-level reductions
- Reducing synchronization overhead
- Handling boundary conditions efficiently
- Providing good scalability for various input sizes
