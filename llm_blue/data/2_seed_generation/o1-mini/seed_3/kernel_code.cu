    Optimization Strategy:
    1. **Enhanced Grid-Stride Loop with Higher Unrolling Factor**: The kernel employs a grid-stride loop with an unrolling factor of 8. This allows each thread to process eight elements per iteration, significantly reducing loop overhead and increasing instruction-level parallelism, which is particularly beneficial for large input sizes (up to 1B elements).
    
    2. **Coalesced Global Memory Accesses**: By accessing consecutive memory locations in a strided manner, threads within a warp access contiguous memory regions, ensuring coalesced global memory accesses. This maximizes memory bandwidth utilization and minimizes memory latency.
    
    3. **Warp-Level Reduction Using `__shfl_down_sync`**: Intra-warp reductions are performed using warp shuffle operations (`__shfl_down_sync`), which enable threads within a warp to collaboratively reduce their partial sums without the need for shared memory. This approach reduces latency and avoids shared memory bank conflicts.
    
    4. **Per-Warp Partial Sums Stored in Shared Memory**: After intra-warp reductions, each warp's partial sum is stored in shared memory. The shared memory is accessed in a bank-conflict-free manner by mapping one shared memory slot per warp. This layout ensures efficient access patterns and minimizes shared memory bank conflicts.
    
    5. **Final Block-Wide Reduction with Loop Unrolling**: The final reduction of per-warp partial sums in shared memory is performed by the first warp. The reduction loop is manually unrolled to eliminate loop overhead and ensure consistent execution paths across threads, enhancing performance.
    
    6. **Boundary Checks for Correctness**: All memory accesses within the grid-stride loop are guarded with boundary checks using the `size` parameter. This ensures that the kernel correctly handles input arrays of arbitrary sizes, ranging from small (1K) to very large (1B) elements without accessing out-of-bounds memory.
    
    7. **Minimized Synchronization Overhead**: Synchronization primitives (`__syncthreads()`) are used judiciously to coordinate between warps only when necessary (i.e., after writing to shared memory). This minimizes synchronization overhead and avoids unnecessary stalls, contributing to overall performance improvements.
    
    By integrating these optimization techniques, the kernel achieves high throughput and scalability, outperforming previous implementations, especially for large-scale reductions involving up to one billion elements.
