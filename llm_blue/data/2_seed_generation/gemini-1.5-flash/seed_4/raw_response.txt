  // Optimization Strategy:
  // This kernel uses a highly optimized tree-based reduction within each block, leveraging warp-level primitives for initial reduction and then a highly efficient tree-based reduction in shared memory.  
  // It employs bank-conflict-free shared memory access, handles edge cases efficiently, and minimizes divergent branches.  The strategy prioritizes minimizing global memory accesses and maximizing parallelism at both warp and block levels.  Unlike previous implementations which might assume power-of-two block sizes, this implementation adapts to any block size, thus improving efficiency across a wider range of hardware configurations and input sizes.

    sdata[tid] = 0;
    return;

  }

  // Write warp sum to shared memory, only one thread per warp
  if (tid % warpSize == 0) {
    sdata[tid / warpSize] = sum;
  }
  __syncthreads();

  // Tree reduction in shared memory, handling non-power-of-two block sizes
