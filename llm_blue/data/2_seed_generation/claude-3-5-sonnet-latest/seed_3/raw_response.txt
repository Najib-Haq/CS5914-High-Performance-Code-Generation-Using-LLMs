Here's my optimized implementation that combines the best aspects of previous versions while introducing additional optimizations:

```cuda
/*
 * Optimization strategy:
 * 1. Processes 32 elements per thread during load to maximize arithmetic intensity
 *    and minimize memory transactions (better for very large arrays)
 * 2. Uses three-stage reduction:
 *    a) Sequential accumulation during loading (32 elements)
 *    b) Warp-level reduction using shuffle operations
 *    c) Cross-warp reduction using minimal shared memory
 * 3. Employs vectorized loads (int4) where possible to improve memory throughput
 * 4. Uses grid-stride processing with careful boundary handling
 * 5. Minimizes shared memory usage to maximize occupancy
 * 6. Reduces synchronization points to absolute minimum
 * 7. Completely eliminates bank conflicts through sequential addressing
 * 8. Uses template metaprogramming-style unrolling for critical paths

    const unsigned int tid = threadIdx.x;
    const unsigned int lane = tid & 31;
    const unsigned int wid = tid >> 5;
    const unsigned int gridSize = blockDim.x * gridDim.x * 32;
    unsigned int idx = blockIdx.x * (blockDim.x * 32) + tid;
    
    // Thread-local sum
    long long sum = 0; // Using long long to prevent overflow during accumulation
    
    // Grid-stride loop, each thread handles 32 elements
    while (idx < size) {
        // Vectorized loads where possible
        if (idx + 31 * blockDim.x < size && (idx % 4) == 0) {
            int4 in4;
            #pragma unroll

                in4 = reinterpret_cast<int4*>(input)[idx/4 + i * blockDim.x/4];
                sum += in4.x + in4.y + in4.z + in4.w;
            }
        } else {

    }
    
    // Warp-level reduction using shuffle
    #pragma unroll
    for (int offset = 16; offset > 0; offset >>= 1) {
        sum += __shfl_down_sync(0xffffffff, sum, offset);
    }
    
    // Write warp results to shared memory
    if (lane == 0) {
        sdata[wid] = static_cast<int>(sum);
    }
    __syncthreads();
    
    // Final reduction (only first warp)
    if (wid == 0) {
        sum = (lane < (blockDim.x >> 5)) ? sdata[lane] : 0;
        
        #pragma unroll
        for (int offset = (blockDim.x >> 6); offset > 0; offset >>= 1) {
            sum += __shfl_down_sync(0xffffffff, sum, offset);
        }
        
        if (lane == 0) {
            output[blockIdx.x] = static_cast<int>(sum);
        }
    }
}
```

This implementation introduces several key improvements:
1. Increased elements per thread (32) to better handle large arrays
2. Vectorized loads using int4 to improve memory throughput
3. Uses long long for intermediate sums to prevent overflow
4. Combines best practices from both previous implementations
5. Optimized boundary checking for better performance at array edges
6. Reduced shared memory usage to improve occupancy

The implementation should show better performance especially for large arrays due to reduced memory transactions and improved arithmetic intensity.
