After analyzing the previous implementations, here's an optimized version that combines the best aspects of both while introducing additional improvements:

```cuda
/*
 * Optimization strategy:
 * 1. Uses 16 elements per thread during load to significantly reduce memory transactions
 *    and total thread count (better for very large arrays)
 * 2. Implements two-stage reduction: first parallel within warps using shuffle,
 *    then across warps using shared memory
 * 3. Completely eliminates shared memory bank conflicts using sequential addressing
 * 4. Minimizes divergent execution by removing most conditional statements
 * 5. Uses grid-stride loop with unrolled inner loop for handling large arrays
 * 6. Employs full warp-level primitives to eliminate synchronization in final stages
 * 7. Reduces register pressure by reusing variables where possible
 * 8. Maintains coalesced memory access patterns during initial loading

__global__ void sumReduction(int *input, int *output, int size) {
    extern __shared__ int sdata[];
    
    const unsigned int tid = threadIdx.x;
    const unsigned int wid = tid >> 5;  // Warp ID
    const unsigned int lane = tid & 31;  // Lane within warp
    const unsigned int gridSize = blockDim.x * gridDim.x * 16;
    unsigned int idx = blockIdx.x * (blockDim.x * 16) + tid;
    
    // Thread-local sum
    int sum = 0;
    
    // Grid-stride loop, each thread handles 16 elements
    while (idx < size) {
        #pragma unroll
        for (int i = 0; i < 16; i++) {
            unsigned int curr_idx = idx + i * blockDim.x;
            if (curr_idx < size) {
                sum += input[curr_idx];
            }
        }
        idx += gridSize;
    }
    
    // First reduction using warp shuffle
    #pragma unroll
    for (int offset = 16; offset > 0; offset >>= 1) {
        sum += __shfl_down_sync(0xffffffff, sum, offset);
    }
    
    // Write warp results to shared memory
    if (lane == 0) {
        sdata[wid] = sum;
    }
    __syncthreads();
    
    // Final reduction across warps
    if (tid < (blockDim.x >> 5)) {  // Only first warp
        sum = (tid < (blockDim.x >> 5)) ? sdata[tid] : 0;
        
        #pragma unroll
        for (int offset = (blockDim.x >> 6); offset > 0; offset >>= 1) {
            sum += __shfl_down_sync(0xffffffff, sum, offset);
        }
        
        if (lane == 0) {
            output[blockIdx.x] = sum;
        }
    }
}
```

This implementation introduces several key improvements:
1. Processes 16 elements per thread (vs. 4 or 8 in previous versions) to better handle very large arrays
2. Uses a hybrid approach combining warp shuffle operations with shared memory
3. Minimizes shared memory usage and bank conflicts
4. Reduces synchronization points
5. Optimizes for both small and large array sizes through efficient grid-stride processing
6. Reduces register pressure while maintaining high throughput

The implementation should perform better for large arrays due to increased work per thread and reduced memory transactions, while maintaining good performance for smaller arrays through efficient warp-level operations.
