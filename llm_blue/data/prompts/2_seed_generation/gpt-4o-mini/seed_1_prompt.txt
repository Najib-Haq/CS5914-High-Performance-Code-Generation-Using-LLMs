You are an expert in high-performance CUDA programming. Generate a CUDA kernel function that performs a sum reduction on an array of integers.

Implement ONLY the kernel function with this exact signature:
__global__ void sumReduction(int *input, int *output, int size)

The kernel should:
- Take an input array of integers, an output array to store block results, and the size of the input array
- Use shared memory appropriately sized with extern __shared__
- Handle array boundaries correctly using the 'size' parameter
- Use tree-based reduction for high performance
- Use synchronization appropriately
- Aim for the best performance across all input sizes (1K to 1B elements)

Here are previous kernel implementations with their performance metrics:

Implementation 1:
```cuda
__global__ void sumReduction(int *input, int *output, int size) {
    // Define the number of threads in a block
    extern __shared__ int sharedData[];

    // Calculate the global thread index
    int tid = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    int localTid = threadIdx.x;

    // Initialize shared memory for this block
    // Load elements from global memory to shared memory
    if (tid < size) {
        sharedData[localTid] = input[tid];
    } else {
        sharedData[localTid] = 0; // Handle out-of-bounds by assigning zero
    }
    
    // Synchronize to ensure all data is loaded
    __syncthreads();

    // Perform tree-based reduction in shared memory
    for (int stride = blockDim.x / 2; stride > 0; stride /= 2) {
        if (localTid < stride) {
            sharedData[localTid] += sharedData[localTid + stride];
        }
        __syncthreads(); // Wait for all threads to finish the reduction step
    }

    // Only the first thread in the block writes the result to global memory
    if (localTid == 0) {
        output[blockIdx.x] = sharedData[0];
    }
}
```
Performance:
- Size 1024: 0.208896 ms
- Size 1000000: 0.210368 ms
- Size 1000000000: 6.10931 ms

IMPORTANT: Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the previous implementations before designing your approach.

Consider implementing a different strategy such as but not limited to:
- Bank-conflict-free memory access patterns
- Sequential addressing vs. strided addressing
- Warp-level primitives like __shfl_down_sync() for warp-level reductions
- Loop unrolling for the reduction phase
- Early exit strategies to reduce unnecessary work
- Minimizing divergent execution paths

Your goal is to create an implementation that performs better than previous ones, especially for large input sizes (1B elements).

First, briefly explain (in comments) your optimization strategy and why you believe it will be effective.

The wrapper code will:
- Call your kernel with blocks and threads: sumReduction<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock, threadsPerBlock * sizeof(int)>>>(d_input, d_output, size)
- Handle the final reduction across blocks

Output ONLY the kernel function, starting with __global__ void sumReduction
