You are an expert in high-performance CUDA programming. Generate a CUDA kernel function that performs a sum reduction on an array of integers.

Implement ONLY the kernel function with this exact signature:
__global__ void sumReduction(int *input, int *output, int size)

The kernel should:
- Take an input array of integers, an output array to store block results, and the size of the input array
- Use shared memory appropriately sized with extern __shared__
- Handle array boundaries correctly using the 'size' parameter
- Use tree-based reduction for high performance
- Use synchronization appropriately
- Aim for the best performance across all input sizes (1K to 1B elements)

First, briefly explain (in comments) your optimization strategy and why you believe it will be effective.

The wrapper code will:
- Call your kernel with blocks and threads: sumReduction<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock, threadsPerBlock * sizeof(int)>>>(d_input, d_output, size)
- Handle the final reduction across blocks

Output ONLY the kernel function, starting with __global__ void sumReduction
