You are an expert in high-performance CUDA programming. Generate a CUDA kernel function that performs a sum reduction on an array of integers.

Implement ONLY the kernel function with this exact signature:
__global__ void sumReduction(int *input, int *output, int size)

The kernel should:
- Take an input array of integers, an output array to store block results, and the size of the input array
- Use shared memory appropriately sized with extern __shared__
- Handle array boundaries correctly using the 'size' parameter
- Use tree-based reduction for high performance
- Use synchronization appropriately
- Aim for the best performance across all input sizes (1K to 1B elements)

Here are previous kernel implementations with their performance metrics:

Implementation 1:
```cuda
__global__ void sumReduction(int *input, int *output, int size) {
    // Optimization Strategy:
    // - The strategy employs a tree-based reduction algorithm using shared memory to minimize global memory access and to provide parallel reduction within a block.
    // - Each thread initially loads a segment of the input data into shared memory for fast access.
    // - The algorithm then reduces the data in multiple steps, halving the number of active threads with each step. This ensures that the reduction process is highly parallelized, making efficient use of GPU resources.
    // - External memory access only occurs at the very end to store the result to global memory, minimizing memory transaction overhead.

    extern __shared__ int sharedMem[];
    unsigned int tid = threadIdx.x;
    unsigned int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;

    // Load data into shared memory
    int tempSum = (idx < size) ? input[idx] : 0;
    sharedMem[tid] = tempSum;
    __syncthreads();

    // Perform tree-based reduction
    for (int s=blockDim.x/2; s>0; s>>=1) {
        if (tid < s) {
            sharedMem[tid] += sharedMem[tid + s];
        }
        __syncthreads();
    }

    // Only thread 0 writes result for this block to global memory
    if (tid == 0) {
        output[blockIdx.x] = sharedMem[0];
    }
}
```
Performance:
- Size 1024: 14.4466 ms
- Size 1000000: 0.249184 ms
- Size 1000000000: 6.00755 ms

Implementation 2:
```cuda
// Optimized Kernel using Warps to Reduce Bank Conflicts and Improve Performance
// - Utilizes warp-level reduction followed by block-level reduction for efficient parallelism
// - Uses __shfl_down_sync to perform reduction within each warp, reducing bank conflicts and improving shared memory usage
// - This strategy reduces the number of synchronization points and minimizes thread divergence for better performance
// - Early termination for threads not involved in reduction steps minimizes unnecessary work
// - Handles boundary cases and odd-sized arrays efficiently
// - Aims to minimize global memory access, ensure efficient shared memory allocation and usage, and enhance parallelism for high throughput

__global__ void sumReduction(int *input, int *output, int size) {
    extern __shared__ int sharedMem[];
    const int tid = threadIdx.x;
    const int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    int data = (idx < size) ? input[idx] : 0;

    // Load data into shared memory
    sharedMem[threadIdx.x] = data;

    // Ensure all threads have loaded their data into shared memory
    __syncthreads();

    // Number of input elements per thread
    int offset = 1;

    // Warp-level reduction using shuffle operations
    for (offset = 1; offset < blockDim.x; offset <<= 1) {
        int lane = threadIdx.x & (offset - 1);
        if (lane < offset) {
            sharedMem[threadIdx.x] += __shfl_down_sync(0xFFFFFFFF, sharedMem[threadIdx.x], offset);
        }
        __syncthreads();
    }

    // The final sum in each block is stored by the first thread
    if (threadIdx.x == 0) {
        output[blockIdx.x] = sharedMem[0];
    }
}
```
Performance:
- Size 1024: 15.8076 ms
- Size 1000000000: 7.12266 ms

IMPORTANT: Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the previous implementations before designing your approach.

Consider implementing a different strategy such as but not limited to:
- Bank-conflict-free memory access patterns
- Sequential addressing vs. strided addressing
- Warp-level primitives like __shfl_down_sync() for warp-level reductions
- Loop unrolling for the reduction phase
- Early exit strategies to reduce unnecessary work
- Minimizing divergent execution paths

Your goal is to create an implementation that performs better than previous ones, especially for large input sizes (1B elements).

First, briefly explain (in comments) your optimization strategy and why you believe it will be effective.

The wrapper code will:
- Call your kernel with blocks and threads: sumReduction<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock, threadsPerBlock * sizeof(int)>>>(d_input, d_output, size)
- Handle the final reduction across blocks

Output ONLY the kernel function, starting with __global__ void sumReduction
