You are an expert in high-performance CUDA programming. Generate a CUDA kernel function that performs a sum reduction on an array of integers.

Implement ONLY the kernel function with this exact signature:
__global__ void sumReduction(int *input, int *output, int size)

The kernel should:
- Take an input array of integers, an output array to store block results, and the size of the input array
- Use shared memory appropriately sized with extern __shared__
- Handle array boundaries correctly using the 'size' parameter
- Use tree-based reduction for high performance
- Use synchronization appropriately
- Aim for the best performance across all input sizes (1K to 1B elements)

Here are previous kernel implementations with their performance metrics:

Implementation 1:
```cuda
__global__ void sumReduction(int *input, int *output, int size) {
  // Optimization Strategy:
  // This kernel uses a tree-based reduction within each block, maximizing shared memory usage and minimizing global memory accesses.  
  // The choice of threadsPerBlock is not hardcoded to adapt to different sizes.  The algorithm efficiently handles any power-of-two size and gracefully handles non-power-of-two sizes by processing the remainder separately.
  // Synchronization using __syncthreads() ensures data consistency between threads within a block.

  extern __shared__ int sdata[]; // Allocate shared memory dynamically

  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  int tid = threadIdx.x;

  // Load data from global memory to shared memory
  if (i < size) {
    sdata[tid] = input[i];
  } else {
    sdata[tid] = 0; // Initialize to 0 for indices beyond the input array size.
  }
  __syncthreads();


  // Tree-based reduction in shared memory
  for (int s = blockDim.x / 2; s > 0; s >>= 1) {
    if (tid < s) {
      sdata[tid] += sdata[tid + s];
    }
    __syncthreads();
  }

  // Write the block sum to global memory
  if (tid == 0) {
    output[blockIdx.x] = sdata[0];
  }
}
```
Performance:
- Size 1024: 14.8838 ms
- Size 1000000: 0.25056 ms
- Size 1000000000: 6.08643 ms

Implementation 2:
```cuda
__global__ void sumReduction(int *input, int *output, int size) {
  // Optimization Strategy:
  // This kernel uses a warp-level reduction using __shfl_down_sync() before the shared memory reduction. This significantly reduces the number of shared memory accesses and synchronization points, improving performance, especially for large datasets.
  // It also employs bank-conflict-free memory access by ensuring that threads within a warp access different memory banks.  This minimizes memory access latency and improves overall throughput.
  // The number of threads per block is chosen to be a multiple of 32 (warp size) to leverage warp-level primitives effectively.


  extern __shared__ int sdata[]; // Allocate shared memory dynamically

  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  int tid = threadIdx.x;

  // Load data from global memory to shared memory, using bank-conflict free access pattern
  if (i < size) {
    sdata[tid] = input[i + tid % 32 * (blockDim.x / 32) ]; //Bank conflict free access if blockDim.x is multiple of 32
  } else {
    sdata[tid] = 0; 
  }
  __syncthreads();

  // Warp-level reduction
  for (int offset = 16; offset > 0; offset >>= 1) {
    if (tid < offset) {
      sdata[tid] += sdata[tid + offset];
    }
    __syncthreads();
  }

    //Further reduction within the warp using warp-level primitives
    if(tid < 32){
        int val = sdata[tid];
        for(int offset = 16; offset > 0; offset >>=1){
            val += __shfl_down_sync(0xFFFFFFFF, val, offset);
        }
        if(tid == 0) sdata[0] = val;
    }
  __syncthreads();


  // Write the block sum to global memory
  if (tid == 0) {
    output[blockIdx.x] = sdata[0];
  }
}
```
Performance:

IMPORTANT: Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the previous implementations before designing your approach.

Consider implementing a different strategy such as but not limited to:
- Bank-conflict-free memory access patterns
- Sequential addressing vs. strided addressing
- Warp-level primitives like __shfl_down_sync() for warp-level reductions
- Loop unrolling for the reduction phase
- Early exit strategies to reduce unnecessary work
- Minimizing divergent execution paths

Your goal is to create an implementation that performs better than previous ones, especially for large input sizes (1B elements).

First, briefly explain (in comments) your optimization strategy and why you believe it will be effective.

The wrapper code will:
- Call your kernel with blocks and threads: sumReduction<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock, threadsPerBlock * sizeof(int)>>>(d_input, d_output, size)
- Handle the final reduction across blocks

Output ONLY the kernel function, starting with __global__ void sumReduction
