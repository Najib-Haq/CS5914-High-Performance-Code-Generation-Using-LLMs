Okay, so the user wants a CUDA program where each thread prints "Hello from CUDA thread X!" with X being the thread index. They specified that it should be a complete, self-contained program that compiles with nvcc version 12.4.

First, I need to structure the program. It should have a main function, include necessary headers, and launch a kernel. The kernel will be responsible for printing the message.

I'll start by including cuda.h because that's necessary for CUDA functions. Then, in the main function, I'll set up the kernel launch parameters. The grid and block dimensions need to be defined. For simplicity, I'll choose a grid of 2 blocks and each block having 3 threads, so total 6 threads.

Next, the kernel function helloKernel. Each thread should have a unique index. Using blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x gives the global thread index. Then, printf inside the kernel with the message and the index.

After defining the kernel, in the main function, I'll launch the kernel with the specified grid and block dimensions. It's important to include cudaDeviceSynchronize() to ensure the kernel completes before the program exits, so the output is visible.

I should also handle any potential CUDA errors by checking the return values, but since the user didn't specify error handling, I'll keep it simple for now.

Finally, compiling with nvcc -o output_file will create the executable. The program should print the messages from each thread when run.

I think that covers everything the user asked for. The code should be straightforward and meet the requirements.

```cuda
#include <cuda.h>

__global__ void helloKernel() {
    int tid = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    printf("Hello from CUDA thread %d!\n", tid);
}

int main() {
    const int threadsPerBlock = 3;
    const int numBlocks = 2;
    
    helloKernel<<<numBlocks, threadsPerBlock>>>();
    cudaDeviceSynchronize();
    
    return 0;
}
```
